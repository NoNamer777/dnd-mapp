# DmaIconButton

This is a button component with a style implementation following the DnD Mapp style definition.
The differences between this component and the DmaButtonComponent, is that the DmaButtonComponent allows the button to
also contain text, while the DmaIconButtonComponent only allows icon to be displayed. For more context on what a
DmaIconButtonComponent does, a label can be provided which will be shown by a tooltip.

## Usage

In order to use this component you first need to import its module like so:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; 
import { DmaIconButtonModule } from '@dnd-mapp/shared-components';

@NgModule({
    imports: [DmaIconButtonModule],
})
class MyModule {}
```

After that, you'll be able to use it in your component's template like so:

```html
<button dma-icon-button="filled" dmaIconButtonLabel="Button action">
    <dma-icon icon="plus"></dma-icon>
</button>
```

## Examples

Below are live examples followed by a list of notable attributes.

There are two ways an icon button can be used. By default, clicking the button will make it behave like any other button.
By adding the `toggle` attribute, the button will behave like a toggle button switching between two states when clicked
on it: `selected` and `unselected`. The button will get a `selected` attribute added to the host element whenever it is
in the `selected` state. The difference will be most notable in appearance.

When the icon button is in toggle mode, the layout will be a bit different. In toggle mode, the icon button will look for
two icons within the bounds of the icon button. Use the content projection alias (`ngProjectAs`) with the values `selected-icon` or
`unselected-icon` to determine which icon to show when the button toggles between the selected and unselected state.
Usually, a regular icon is used for the unselected state, while a solid icon is used for the selected state.

We advise to use regular icons for the unselected state and solid icons for the selected state.

```html
<button dma-icon-button toggle dmaIconButtonLabel="Button action">
    <dma-icon icon="star" iconType="regular" ngProjectAs="unselected-icon"></dma-icon>
    <dma-icon icon="star" ngProjectAs="selected-icon"></dma-icon>
</button>
```

Alternatively, you can provide just 1 icon with even when the button is in toggle mode. This is useful for when there is no
regular or solid alternative of the icon you would like to use for the button.

```html
<button dma-icon-button toggle dmaIconButtonLabel="Button action">
    <dma-icon icon="plus" ngProjectAs="toggle-icon"></dma-icon>
</button>
```
