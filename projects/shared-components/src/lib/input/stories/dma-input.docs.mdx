# DmaInput

The DmaInput is an input field which supports a number of text related input types.

## Using the component

To use the component, simply add the component to your imports like so:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DmaInputComponent } from '@dnd-mapp/shared-components';

@Component({
    templateUrl: './my.component.html',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [DmaInputComponent]
})
class MyComponent {}
```
After that you can start using the DmaInputComponent in your template like so:

```html
<dma-input inputType="text" label="label Text" forLabel="input-field" />
```

Find the Common input field example below and it's controls to find out more about the inputs of the component.

## Common input field

<Canvas of={DmaInputStories.Common} />
<Controls of={DmaInputStories.Common} />

## External label

It is not required to provide a label. Having a label element outside the DmaInputComponent like the example below
will also tie the label to the input.

```html
<label for="input-field">Label text</label>
<dma-input forLabel="input-field" inputType="text" />
```

<Canvas of={DmaInputStories.ExternalLabel} />

## Leading icons

The example below shows how the DmaInputComponent supports leading icons. These icons will be placed before the input
area.

```html
<dma-input inputType="text" label="Label text" supportingText="Supporting text">
    <dma-icon icon="magnifying-glass" class="leading-icon" />
</dma-input>
```

Note that adding the `leading-icon` class on the icon is required for the proper placement of the icon within the input.

This will result in the following output:

<Canvas of={DmaInputStories.LeadingIcon} />

## Trailing icons

The example below shows how the DmaInputComponent also supports trailing icons.

```html
<dma-input inputType="text" label="Label text" supportingText="Supporting text">
    <dma-icon icon="microphone" class="trailing-icon" />
</dma-input>
```

Note that adding the `trailing-icon` class on the icon is required for the proper placement of the icon within the input.

This will result in the following output:

<Canvas of={DmaInputStories.TrailingIcon} />

## Angular forms compatible

The DmaInputComponent does provide support with Angular Forms. For more info on this, look at the example provided
