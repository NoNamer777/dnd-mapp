<Meta of={DmaColorsStories} />

This theming system provides a wide collection of colors. Below, you'll find a visual representation of all the colors
available in this theming system. You see the name of the color and beside that the base color used for that specific
color. Then below that, you'll find a collection of color values generated from the base color ranging from lighter
(white) to darker (black) colors.

You'll find the variable names of all the colors below their visual representation, should you need to use one specific
color.

In order to use such a specific color for a specific style, you'll add the percentage of lightness to the color name
like in the example below:

```scss
@use '@dnd-mapp/shared-components/assets/styles/colors' as *;

p {
    color: $red80;
}
```

In this example a red color is used at a lightness of 80%.

To use the base color you can either, find the particular lightness percentage and use that variable, or exclude the
percentage all together.

```scss
// The elements below both use the same (base) color red
a {
    color: $red42;
}

span {
    color: $red;
}
```
