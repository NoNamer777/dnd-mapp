# DmaButton

This is a button component with a style implementation following the DnD Mapp style definition.

<Canvas of={DmaButtonStories.Common} />

## Usage

In order to use this component you first need to import its module like so:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; 
import { DmaButtonModule } from '@dnd-mapp/shared-components';

@NgModule({
    imports: [DmaButtonModule],
})
class MyModule {}
```

After that, you'll be able to use it in your component's template like so:

```angular2html
<button dma-button="filled">My Button</button>
```

## Examples

Below is a live example followed by a list of notable attributes.

You can also use DmaIcons within this component like so.
NOTE: It is important that the button currently only supports icons by using the following format:

```angular2html
<button>
<dma-icon dma-plus-so-icon></dma-icon>
text
</button>
```

The order of the text and icon within the button does not matter, the button will make sure that the icon is rendered
before/in front of the text.
