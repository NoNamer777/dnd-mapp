# DmaSelect

The DmaSelectComponent is a similar to an `<select>` element, but with custom styling following the DnD Mapp style
definition.

## Usage

In order to use this component you first need to import its module like so:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DmaSelectModule } from '@dnd-mapp/shared-components';

@Component({
    ...
    imports: [DmaSelectModule],
    ...
})
class MyComponent {}
```

After that, you'll be able to use the DmaSelectComponent and the DmaOptionComponents to build to option picker like so:

```html
<dma-select>
    <dma-option value="1" label="Option 1" />
    <dma-option value="2" label="Option 2" />
    <dma-option value="3" label="Option 3" />
    <dma-option value="4" label="Option 4" />
</dma-select>
```

You can find a live example below with a list of properties that you can set on the DmaSelectComponent.

<Canvas of={DmaSelectStories.Common} />
<Controls of={DmaSelectStories.Common} />

A couple notes on the usage of the DmaSelectComponent:

- The only component that it allows as child components is the DmaOptionComponent

# DmaOption

The DmaOptionComponent is the child component with which you provide options to a User can they can select. This
component has the following attributes:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Required</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>label</td>
            <td>The visual display value that is rendered</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>value</td>
            <td>The technical value of the options which can be of any type. This should be unique among the other options in one select</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
