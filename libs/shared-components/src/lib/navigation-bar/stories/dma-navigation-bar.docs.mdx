# DmaNavigationBar

This component serves as a central place for navigation for when the application viewed on a device with the smallest
screen width.

<Canvas of={DmaNavigationBarStories.Common} />

## Usage

In order to use the components, you first need to import its feature module like so:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DmaNavigationBarModule, DmaIconsModule } from '@dnd-mapp/shared-components';

@Component({
    template: '',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [DmaNavigationBarModule, DmaIconsModule],
})
class MyComponent {}
```

Important to note is that you are required to use icons for the buttons. So if you've not already set up icons for your
application or component, please find the documentation for the icons on how to set those up [here](/docs/dmaicons--docs).

After that, you'll be able to use the navigation bar and its buttons in your template like so:

```angular2html
<footer dma-navigation-bar>
    <dma-navigation-bar-button path="/my-route">
        <dma-icon icon="star"></dma-icon>
        My label
    </dma-navigation-bar-button>
</footer>
```

## Recommendations

The recommended amount of buttons on the navigation bar is at least 3 and no more than 5. The buttons need to do the same
action regardless of what page is shown. Keep the labels short but descriptive to prevent the bottom navigation bar from
looking cluttered.

As shown, you need to provide an icon and a label to make the buttons distinguishable from each other and let Users know
where the buttons lead to or what actions the buttons do.

## DmaNavigationBarButton

The DmaNavigationBarComponent itself doesn't have any attributes that can be set from outside the component, but the
DmaNavigationBarButtonComponent has a couple attributes which can be set. You can find those attributes below.

<Canvas of={DmaNavigationBarButtonStories.Common} />

<Controls of={DmaNavigationBarButtonStories.Common} />

Clicking on the button after it has been selected will have no result, since it's already active.
