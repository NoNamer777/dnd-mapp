## Generating SSL certificate and key

It is possible to develop the server and client application with SSL enabled. For this you'll need to do the following:

1. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) on your local machine
2. Run the following command to install the root CA (You may need to restart your browsers)

```shell
mkcert -install
```

3. Run the following command to generate a certificate

```shell
mkcert -cert-file certificate.pem -key-file certificate-key.pem localhost.dndmapp.nl.eu.org localhost
```

Find the sections in the individual projects about developing with SSL enabled to find more information for those projects
how to use the generated files to develop with SSL.
